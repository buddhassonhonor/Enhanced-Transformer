# Enhanced-Transformer

This repository hosts the code and supplementary artifacts for our Transformer enhancements.

## Supplementary Experiment Results (MBF)

The folder `supplementary/mbf/` contains aggregated results and JSON summaries used to address reviewer requests:

- `experiment_summary.md`: consolidated tables (WikiText-2/103, GPT-2 Small/Medium), efficiency baselines, extended ablations, sensitivity, FLOPs/memory.
- `README.md`: directory description and file schema.
- `**/*.json`: per-experiment summaries (final_info, seed-level results, profiling, comparisons).

These artifacts are intended to be self-contained and lightweight (no large checkpoints).
